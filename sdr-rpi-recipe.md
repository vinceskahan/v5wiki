# Use software-defined radio (SDR) on raspberry pi to collect data

This is a guide to build a very low-cost system that will collect data from any number of wireless sensors.  The recipes in this guide use a USB software-defined radio (SDR) plugged in to a raspberry pi, collecting data from Acurite temperature and temperature/humidity sensors.  This approach will work with many other types of sensors from other manufacturers, and it will run on other computers, not just the raspberry pi.
