This is a benchmark designed to test how fast the files and images can be
generated by WeeWX. Add your results to the end.

The protocol below is designed to be reproducible. It's most easily done using
a pip install of Version 5.

Environment:
- Seasons skin
- Simulator
- wview-extended schema

Steps:
1. Wipe out `archive/weewx.sdb`.
2. Wipe out `public_html`.
3. Run `weewxd` for at least *two* reporting cycles. It's important to do at 
   least two cycles because the ET calculation needs more than one measurement. 
   However, don't let `weewxd` run for so long that the size of the archive file 
   becomes a factor.
4. Then benchmark using `wee_reports`.
5. Look in the log for generation times for the files and images. There should
   be 8 files and 60 images.
