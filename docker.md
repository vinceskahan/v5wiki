# Running WeeWX in Docker

WeeWX can run well in Docker, especially if your weather station is network-accessible.  This can simplify the installation process.

You can start with the [Docker image for weeWX](https://github.com/jgoerzen/docker-weewx) -- there are instructions there on how to easily use it.  The image will cover the installation, and then all you need to handle is the configuration after that.
