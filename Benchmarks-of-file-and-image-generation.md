This is a benchmark designed to test how fast the files and images can be
generated by WeeWX. Add your results to the table at the end.

The protocol below is designed to be reproducible. It's most easily done using
a pip install of Version 5.

### Environment
- Seasons skin
- Simulator
- wview-extended schema

### Steps

1. Wipe out `archive/weewx.sdb`.
2. Run `weewxd` for at least _two_ reporting cycles. It's important to do at 
   least two cycles because the ET calculation needs more than one measurement. 
   However, don't let `weewxd` run for so long that the size of the archive file 
   becomes a factor.
3. Stop `weewxd`.
4. Wipe out `public_html`.
5. Then benchmark using `wee_reports`.
6. Look in the log for generation times for the files and images. There should
   be 8 files and 60 images. If you get only 56 images, it's because you didn't
   let `weewxd` run long enough to generate the needed ET data.
7. Add your results to the table below.
