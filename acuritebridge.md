# How to get data from an Acurite bridge

Acurite introduced the bridge in 2013.  This device listens for signals from Acurite sensors such as the 5-in-1, Tower, and Temperature/Humidity.  Then it transmits sensor data via a wired connection to a TCP/IP network.

When it was first introduced, the bridge sent data to the web service 'acu-link.com'.

In July 2016, Acurite introduced the 'myacurite.com' web service and new firmware to make the bridge device work with it.
