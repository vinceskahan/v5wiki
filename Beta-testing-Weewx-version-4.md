This page is meant as a temporary repository for details to allow people to install and test the beta-releases of weewx 4. The focus will be on Python 3.
## Background
These notes are assuming you have one system, that currently has a working version of Weewx 3.x.

The aim is to install in parallel so that you can switch between both, and errors in weewx 4 will not cause issues with the existing installation.
