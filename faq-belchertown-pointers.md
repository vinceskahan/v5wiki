## Belchertown skin pointers
The Belchertown skin is very popular yet somewhat complicated, especially for new users.

Documentation can be found at:
* The [Github](https://github.com/poblabs/weewx-belchertown) page for the skin - read this first for most issues
* The [wiki](https://github.com/poblabs/weewx-belchertown/wiki) - contains more detailed information for more customized setups

How to customize the charts is documented in the wiki [here](https://github.com/poblabs/weewx-belchertown/wiki/Belchertown-Charts-Documentation).
