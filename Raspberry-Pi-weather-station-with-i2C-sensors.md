##Equipment used and general information#
####Raspberry Pi3#
####FARS (my variation of a design found on the web)#
####i2C sensors and i2C range extenders#
######Range Extenders P82B715#
I have two runs (as shown on the block diagram) and with these extenders I have no problems. I saw one report of            
50 metre cabling in use. I have had no problems with my configuration. The termination requirements etc will be    
detailed on the schematic.
