### AS3935 Service

This is a service for weewx that collects lightning strike data (time of strike, distance to strike) using the AS3935 sensor attached to a Raspberry Pi.  The service augments the standard weewx archive record and optionally saves per-strike data to a separate lightning strike database.

### How to Install

2.  Run the extension installer:

    ```
setup.py install --extension weewx-as3935-x.y.tgz
```

5.  Modify weewx.conf:

    ```
    [AS3935]
        address = 3
        bus = 1
```

6. Restart weewx

    ```
sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start
```

### Options

The default configuration will add the fields `lightning_strikes` and `avg_distance` to each archive record.  To save these in the weewx database (so that they can be used in reports and plots), extend the database schema as explained in the weewx customization guide.  You must add two columns, `lightning_strikes` and `avg_distance`.

_data_binding_ - Specify a data binding to save lightning data to a separate lightning database.  For example,

```
[AS3935]
    data_binding = lightning_sqlite
```

will save data to a sqlite database in the same directory as the other weewx databases.  The lightning database schema is a format that works with the weewx reporting and plotting utilities, so you can extract lightning data and use it in standard weewx reports and plots.
