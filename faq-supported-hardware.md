## Does WeeWX work on my weather station hardware ?

Maybe.  Probably.   It depends.

Please see the [wiki listing of compatible hardware](hardware.htm) for a list with pointers to which driver to use and how experimental that driver is for that particular hardware model.

Systems that are based on Fine Offset, AcuRite, and WMR are particularly difficult to quantify, as they are rebranded to so many model numbers from so many vendors that it is hard to know for certain.

Please note the wiki contains a non-inclusive list, so it is entirely possible your model might work. Search the weewx-user group for your model number to see if anybody has run WeeWX on your hardware already.
