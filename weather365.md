More than 20 years of experience in marine weather forecasting give us the ability to provide you with the most precise and applicable weather service and data base for your weather predictions.

In our independent data processing service center we calculate the weather forecast 4 times a day. On base of the actual measurement values of more than 40.000 measurement stations worldwide our optimised numerical weather models (WRF/ETA, WW3) provide exact weather predictions worldwide. 

If  you are planning a trip, a tour, a sailing trip or other activities - detailed weather-forecasts will influence your planning.

Do you want to be sure of your plans so that your equipment and your choice are suitable to the weather?
WEATHER365 provides weather forecasts and all relevant weather-data at a glance – sun, clouds, rain, snow, wind speed, wave forecasts, ozonlevels, pollenlevels and much more.

We have more then 100 stations working with our new receiver based on a raspberry pi receiving DAVIS Station signals directly.

We have also built solar powered stations with GSM and GPS receiving DAVIS Station data building an agriculture network and also a network for sailors here.
