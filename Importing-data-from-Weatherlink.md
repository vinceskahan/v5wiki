Davis Instruments supplies a program called Weatherlink for downloading data from their weather stations.  If you have been using Weatherlink in the past, you will have \.wlk files in your Weatherlink directory which contain your archived sensor data.  You can transfer your weather data from the wlk files to WeeWx using the wee_import utility.  But you must first convert the wlk file data to an appropriate CSV format.  The program wlkReader is a windows program for doing this conversion.  You will find more info on wlkReader at the GitHub page : https://github.com/stevepr/wlkReader
