The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It’s a capable little PC which can be used for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video.  As of October 2013, cost is 25 US$. Expect to add a powered USB hub for reliable operation with most USB weather stations.

The Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless ($10, one inch x 3 inches) works great too!

Now in their fourth generation, these are small, low-powered, fanless PCs that are extremely rugged. The weewx "home" station in Hood River has been running their original "Fit-PC Slim" continuously since 2008, without a failure. Unfortunately, they are pretty expensive (around $500 USD including a hard disk).
