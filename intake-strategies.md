# Strategies for getting data into weeWX

Sometimes data collector.  But also very handy reporting engine.

## Standalone: Driver for hardware data source

classic weather station configuration

## Standalone: Driver for network-based data source

the weatherlink/netatmo configuration

## Standalone: Driver with services

weather station plus one-wire sensors

## Multiple instances

weather station plus multiple ultrasonic sensors, composite report

## Mixing it with other hardware

weather station plus arduinos, composite report.  feed a sqlite database from somewhere other than weewx, then use that in a weewx report.
