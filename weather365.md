Meteo-Services - Institute f. Weather and Climate Analyses 
More than 30 years of experience with weather and climate change analyses - we try to analyze the regional things with your existing stations to get a better picture how fast climate change goes on. 

In our independent data processing service center we calculate the weather forecast 4 times a day. On base of the actual measurement values of more than 40.000 measurement stations worldwide our optimised numerical weather models (WRF/ETA, WW3) provide exact weather predictions worldwide.

If you are planning a trip, a tour, a sailing trip or other activities - detailed weather-forecasts will influence your planning.

Do you want to be sure of your plans so that your equipment and your choice are suitable to the weather? Meteo-Services provides weather forecasts and all relevant weather-data at a glance – sun, clouds, rain, snow, wind speed, wave forecasts and much more.

We have more then 200 stations working with our new receiver based on a raspberry pi receiving DAVIS Station signals directly. If you´re interested to get such a module for your pi please contact us. info@meteo-services.com. We still have a few version 1 platines (B) for experiments.

We have also built solar powered stations with GSM and GPS receiving DAVIS Station data building an agriculture network and also a network for sailors here.

The extension for weeWX will send data to our network. This extension allows weeWX to send data to the Meteo-Services network.

The service is free. We use your weather data for model-control and development.

We give each registered station owner access to our professional network - PROFESSIONAL account at meteo-services.com where we run and show our own forecast models. How to get the PROFESSIONAL account? Please register your weatherstation and start sharing your data with us. Note your stationid. Sign up / Create a new account on www.weather365.net. Send us email (support@meteo-services.com) with your username and your stationid. We will check and set you´re new account to PROFESSIONAL for free when sharing your data with us.
