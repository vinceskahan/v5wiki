## User Expectations

WeeWX is a Linux/Unix command-line application, which means that 'click in the gui' type Windows/Mac users frequently have some growing pains. This requires some investment of your time and energy to reach a minimal command-line level of expertise that is enough to manage your WeeWX system efficiently.
