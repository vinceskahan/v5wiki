# Collect data from the ecowitt GW1000 wifi bridge

This guide shows how to configure weeWX to collect data from the ecowitt GW1000 wifi bridge.  The GW1000 is manufactured by Fine Offset.  It receives 915MHz radio signals from a wide assortment of Fine Offset sensors, then sends the data via WiFi to various online services.  The bridge itself is small, powered by USB, and has no interface other than a single button and two LEDs.  It includes pressure, temperature, and humidity sensor at the end of an attached 1 meter wire.
