The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It’s a capable little PC which
can be used for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also
plays high-definition video.  As of October 2013, cost is 25 US$. Expect to add a powered USB hub for reliable operation
with most USB weather stations.

The Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless ($10, one inch x 3 inches) works great too!

Now in their fourth generation, these are small, low-powered, fanless PCs that are extremely rugged. The weewx "home"
station in Hood River has been running their original "Fit-PC Slim" continuously since 2008, without a failure.
Unfortunately, they are pretty expensive (around $500 USD including a hard disk).

The GL-MT300N-V1 is a travel router which runs OpenWrt. It has two FastEthernet ports, USB and WLAN. I have atatched an
USB-Hub where I have inserted a 16GM USB thumb drive to enlarge the small filesystem following the ExtRoot configuration
https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/extroot_configuration and I have pluged-in in anouther USB port
the WH1080 from Fine Offset.

Everything runs fine so far and my station reports to wetter.com, Wunderground, WeatherObservationsWebsite and to my
personal website at http://lieberlinge.ddnss.de/weather/

The GL-MT300N-V2 is currently available at amazon Germany for less than EUR 25.

Linux-enabled Allwinner A20 development board with Ethernet, HDMI output, 1GB DDR3 RAM memory, two SD card connectors, plenty of free GPIOs and much more.

Also includes a SATA port and optional steel case with internal battery backup option.  The case has provision for mounting a 2 inch form factor internal hard drive or SSD.

It has good OS support from Armbian (community) and Debian.  ALARM (Arch Linux ARM) was tried but it would never direct output through the HDMI port.
