Wind chill kicks in only for temperatures less than 50°F and wind speeds over 3mph. Ref: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/winter/windchill.shtml

Heat index kicks in for temperatures above 80°F and humidities above 40%. Ref: http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/heatindex_equation.shtml

Otherwise, you get regular temperatures.
