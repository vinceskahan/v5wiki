# Strategies for getting data into weeWX

Sometimes data collector.  But also very handy reporting engine.

## Standalone: Driver for hardware data source

## Standalone: Driver for network-based data source

## Standalone: Driver with services

## Multiple instances

weather station plus ultrasonic sensors, composite report

## Mixing it with other hardware

weather station plus arduinos, composite report.  feed a sqlite database from somewhere other than weewx, then use that in a weewx report.
